This repository has all the work I developed while I was at the University of Edinburgh (Summer 2019).

In the "Tomas' work.pdf" file you can find a detailed description of everything I did and the problems I had.

UPDATE: Regarding the problem I had with parallelisation in PhysX, I believe it might have something to do with the heap memory. Maybe the code will work if the heap memory is increased, but I'm not sure of this.


Best of luck to whoever works on this afterwards!
